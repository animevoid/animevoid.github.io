            <p class="summry">Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures
                called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants
                truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be
                out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive
                barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is
                soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting
                the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

                After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates
                his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats
                the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning
                manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood
                friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of
                defeating them before the last walls are breached.<br>
