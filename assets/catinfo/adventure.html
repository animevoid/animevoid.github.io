            <p class="summry">Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather
                than the
                popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for
                being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing
                people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy
                and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and
                battling strong enemies,<br> All in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.

                Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the
                Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the
                monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto.

                Now, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of
                the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village, while his burning desire to
                become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly
                foes.<br>

                tasks like capturing criminals and bravely searching for lost treasures in uncharted territories.
                Twelve-year-old Gon Freecss is determined to become the best Hunter possible in hopes of finding his

                Along the way to becoming an official Hunter, Gon befriends the lively doctor-in-training Leorio,
                vengeful Kurapika, and rebellious ex-assassin Killua. To attain their own goals and desires, together
                the four of them take the Hunter Exam, notorious for its low success rate and high probability of death.
                Throughout their journey, Gon and his friends embark on an adventure that puts them through many
                hardships and struggles. They will meet a plethora of monsters, creatures, and characters—all while

                Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result.

                However, as Rukia is unable to regain her powers, Ichigo is given the daunting task of hunting down the

                children, they came to know of the "Wizard King"—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and
                promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King. However,
                as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic
                with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers
                by training physically.<br>

                When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while
                Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty, whose main
                purpose is to obtain Yuno's Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though without
                hope and on the brink of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno's voice.
                Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "Black Clover"
                giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later, the two friends head out into the world,
                both seeking the same goal—to become the Wizard King!<br>

                many people, known as Pokemon trainers, capture and train them, often with the intent of battling
                others. Young Satoshi has not only dreamed of becoming a Pokemon trainer but also a "Pokemon Master,"
                and on the arrival of his 10th birthday, he finally has a chance to make that dream a reality.
                Unfortunately for him, all three Pokemon available to beginning trainers have already been claimed and
                only Pikachu, a rebellious Electric type Pokemon, remains. However, this chance encounter would mark the
                start of a lifelong friendship and an epic adventure!<br>

                Setting off on a journey to become the very best, Satoshi and Pikachu travel across beautiful, sprawling
                regions with their friends Kasumi, a Water type trainer, and Takeshi, a Rock type trainer. But danger
                lurks around every corner. The infamous Team Rocket is always nearby, seeking to steal powerful Pokemon
                through nefarious schemes. It'll be up to Satoshi and his friends to thwart their efforts as he also
                strives to earn the eight Pokemon Gym Badges he'll need to challenge the Pokemon League, and eventually
                claim the title of Pokemon Master.<br>
