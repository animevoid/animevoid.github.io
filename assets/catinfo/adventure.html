            <p class="summry">Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather
                than the
                popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for
                being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing
                people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy
                and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and
                battling strong enemies,<br> All in order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes—One Piece.

            <p class="summry">Moments prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed
                Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the
                Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the
                monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto.

                Now, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of
                the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village, while his burning desire to
                become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly
                foes.<br>

            <p class="summry">Hunter x Hunter is set in a world where Hunters exist to perform all manner of dangerous
                tasks like capturing criminals and bravely searching for lost treasures in uncharted territories.
                Twelve-year-old Gon Freecss is determined to become the best Hunter possible in hopes of finding his
                father, who was a Hunter himself and had long ago abandoned his young son. However, Gon soon realizes
                the path to achieving his goals is far more challenging than he could have ever imagined.

                Along the way to becoming an official Hunter, Gon befriends the lively doctor-in-training Leorio,
                vengeful Kurapika, and rebellious ex-assassin Killua. To attain their own goals and desires, together
                the four of them take the Hunter Exam, notorious for its low success rate and high probability of death.
                Throughout their journey, Gon and his friends embark on an adventure that puts them through many
                hardships and struggles. They will meet a plethora of monsters, creatures, and characters—all while
                learning what being a Hunter truly means.<br>
